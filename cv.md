## 3. Briefly about myself
I'm 25 years old. I`m working at bank system for 6 years. I started in contact center of Belinvestbank, where I worked with clients requests. A year later I moved to the lending department of Belinvestnak and worked with clients of small and medium-sized businesses. Three years later I moved to the department of work with corporate clients. And 9 months ago I changed bank and started work in VTB-Bank (Belarus) in the lending department with clients of medium-sized businesses.
